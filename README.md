Hi, I’m Alan Ayoub and I’m from Los Angeles. I’m currently a junior software engineer in for a Top 100 company working from the Pasadena location. My daily tasks range from application security, development, documentation, and keeping our applications current. I’m eager to learn, grow, and use my skills to communicate my creativity.

I currently rarely use twitter or youtube, but I’m plan to change that.
